# Introduction

Optimization algorithms are crucial in various fields such as machine learning, operations research, and engineering. This repository focuses on two popular metaheuristic algorithms:

## Differential Evolution Algorithm
Differential Evolution is an evolutionary optimization algorithm that relies on the mutation, crossover, and selection operations to evolve solutions towards the optimum.

1. Mutation: Creates a donor vector by adding the weighted difference between two population vectors to a third vector.
2. Crossover: Combines the donor vector with the target vector to produce a trial vector.
3. Selection: Compares the trial vector with the target vector, retaining the one with the better fitness.

## Particle Swarm Optimization
Particle Swarm Optimization mimics the social behavior of swarms. Each particle adjusts its position based on its own experience and the experience of neighboring particles to find the optimal solution.

1. Position Update: Particles move through the search space by updating their position and velocity.
2. Velocity Update: Influenced by the particle's own best position and the global best position found by the swarm.
